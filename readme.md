## Test-Retest Reliability and Factor Structure of the Tower of London and Go/No Go Computerized Tasks from the Psychology Experiment Building Language (PEBL) 


**Study 1** examined the reliability of a broad spectrum of indicators (Initial Time Thinking, ITT; Execution Time, ET; Full Time, FT; Extra Moves, EM; No Go Errors, NGE; Reaction Time for Go Responses, RTGR) across an eight-week delay in a sample of 21 young adults. Before analyses, the raw results of not normally distributed variables were transformed, and results were corrected for multiple comparisons and correlations.

Included files:

1. Dataset: “Data of test-retest reliability for TOL and GNG” (xls, sav).
2. Syntax: “Syntax for test-retest reliability for TOL and GNG” for all performed calculations (sav).
3. Calculators (xls):
    1. “Calculator for standard error of the difference by Iverson” of SDiff
    2. “Holm correction for multiple comparisons”
    3. “Holm correction for ICC”
    4. “Holm correction for multiple correlations”
    5. "Calculator for effect size”

**Study 2** investigated factor structure of general indicators (Initial Time Thinking, ITT; Extra Moves, ET; Extra Moves, EM; No Go Errors, NGE; Reaction Time for Go Responses, RTGR) in the TOL and GNG tasks, and conducted a more detailed analysis of indicators for each trial (Initial Time Thinking, ITT; Extra Moves, ET; Extra Moves, EM) in the TOL task in the group of 95 young adults. Before analyses, the raw results of variables that were not normally distributed were trans-formed.

Included files:
1.	Dataset: “Data of factor structure of the TOL and GNG” (xls, sav).
2.	Syntax: “Syntax for factor structure of the TOL and GNG” for all performed calculations (sav).
